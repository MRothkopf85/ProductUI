I am building a user interface with javascript and some jquery that is populated by a for loop from an array of products and their individual details.  Once the products load with the abridged details, I want the user to be able to click on a 'details' button that will have make a pop up window appear showing the full details of the selected item.  I have everything working HOWEVER the window is populated by the last item created by the for loop, as opposed to those of the item selected.  I am pretty new to javascript and haven't been able to find any solutions that would fit this problem. Any ideas on how to accomplish this?
